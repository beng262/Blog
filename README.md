# A Personal Blog
*made for desktop*

I made this web application using CSS for an UI Hackathon, and I became a finalist.I wanted to showcase different aspects of myself in the blog. For the competition I mostly focused on UI aspect of it but maybe in the future I can add more functionalities to it. If you're using mobile use desktop mode to get the full experience.
